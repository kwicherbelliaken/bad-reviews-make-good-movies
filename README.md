What is `bad reviews make good movies`?

Every (crap) movie today gets high applause. There isn't a single Netflix release that isn't laudered as being "groundbreaking and as brilliant as it is raw". The Tomatometer rings high for mostly anything nowadays. It's all very misleading. Historically, I have based my movie watching on reviews. But, now that these reviews are seemingly meaningless, I need another method for picking which movies I will watch. 

I found Google Reviews to be something of an antidote. Not perfect, not by a long shot. A lot of the reviews are rambling, they start strong and then devolve into talk of fringe conspiracies. All good reading. So, I figured that I'd create a website where I could search for movies and have the ranking of the movie be the product of a meta analysis of all the Google Reviews made on the movie. If the sentiment in the Google Reviews was bad, well, then the movie would be ranked poorly. 

This is how I planned to better determine which movies were worth watching and which weren't. I was going to the hoardes for advice! 

Did I achieve this? Some of it. I have a lot to do, as is better outlined in the Roadmap.
